Ever wanted to host a fun personalised team event? Crank out a minecraft server.  I did this for a team building event during covid lockdowns.  It was soo much fun.


Features
* Sets up the official Minecraft Bedrock Server
* Ubuntu / Debian distributions supported
* Sets up Minecraft as a system service with option to autostart at boot
* Automatic backups when server restarts
* Supports multiple instances — you can run multiple Bedrock servers on the same system
* Updates automatically to the latest or user-defined version when server is started
* Easy control of server with start.sh, stop.sh and restart.sh scripts
* Adds logging with timestamps to “logs” directory
* Optional scheduled daily restart of server using cron
