If you every play around with cloud machines, you would likely know how to lock them down.. but how do you know if they are accessed?

Linux - Set up email notifications for SSH login events.

for example:
A SSH login was successful, so here are some information for security:
# User:        User
# User IP Host: 220.111.4.20
# Service:     sshd
# TTY:         ssh
# Date:        Sun 15 Oct 2023 02:31:46 AM UTC
# Server:      Linux localhost 5.9.0-22-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.9 (2023-04-22) x86_64 GNU/Linux
